project:
  name: "Flask Rental Portal"
  description: >
    A web application that connects **tenants and landlords**, allowing them to find one another, 
    rate each other, and manage rental history transparently. The system includes a **TenantScore**, 
    which evaluates tenants based on **payment history, ratings from landlords, and creditworthiness**. 
    The portal integrates a **mutual rating system** where landlords rate tenants (0-5 stars), 
    and tenants rate landlords (0-5 stars). The project follows a **modular architecture**, ensuring 
    **scalability, security, and efficient database management**.
